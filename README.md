JavaScript Experiment: RPG Character Sheet
==========================================

Building a tabletop RPG character sheet to improve my JavaScript skills

In an attempt to get better at JavaScript, I decided to create a project from scratch, using material that would hold my interest. In this case, building a simplified version of the character builder from the Edge of the Empire role-playing game.

While the goal is to create a functional character sheet, I am also purposefully leaving this as vague as possible so as to not infringe on the Disney/Lucasfilm and Fantasy Flight copyrights. You WILL still need to buy the rulebook in order for this character sheet to be usable in an actual tabletop setting.
